# Metassistant
Django wrapper for managing webapp rapid-prototyping

*under development*

This code contains a lot of 'shell=True', 'sys.path.append(..., os.pardir, os.pardir, ...)', and 'socket.getaddrinfo(...)'.
I would suggest you don't use this unless you know how it all works, and understand the potential security issues.
